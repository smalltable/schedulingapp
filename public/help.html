      <h2>What is TEMPLATED?</h2>
      <p>TEMPLATED is a collection of free, Creative Commons-licensed CSS,

         Doni, AJ, and occasionally our good friends Rafi (design) and Eduardo (code).</p>

      <h2>What is a Site Template?</h2>
      <p>A starting point for a website. Usually consists of at least one or more
        HTML files, a stylesheet, and optionally a few support images and scripts. The HTML
        is where your content lives (eg. text and photos), while the rest of the stuff handles
        the presentation of that content. See this article for a great explanation on how this works.</p>

      <h2>What is a Responsive HTML5 Template?</h2>
      <p>A special kind of site template that's 1. built on HTML5 (the latest HTML standard), and 2.
        designed to respond to the size of your screen and deliver the experience most optimal for it
        (whether it's a huge 30" desktop display or a 4" mobile phone). It does this by automatically
        switching between blocks of CSS rules that each target a specific range of screen sizes (commonly
        referred to as media queries).</p>
